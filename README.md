# SteamCMDLauncher

New way to install, update or configure dedicated servers!



Current doing under developement (public viewing, look at my good coding work hehe)



Any help will be greatful - big idea is to make it avaiable to Linux as well! (.Net Core WPF)



To learn how to use the program, view the tutorial from [here](https://github.com/TheE7Player/SteamCMDLauncher/wiki/Tutorial).



Specs:

- .Net Core 3.1
- WPF
  
  

Dependencies: 

> As of `dev build +0.5.1`, a [vlang](https://github.com/vlang/v) script has been added to verify the `.json` files. This script will run each time after a successful build takes place - `V` has to be assigned to a `symlink`, or you'll face issues when compiling.
> The script is located in [\Resources\sha256_writer.v](https://github.com/TheE7Player/SteamCMDLauncher/blob/master/SteamCMDLauncher/Resources/sha256_writer.v)
